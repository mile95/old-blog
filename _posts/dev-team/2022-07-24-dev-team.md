During my first three years as a software developer, I’ve been working in a few different teams and for me,
working and delivering as a team is one of the most exciting parts of the work.
I’ve realized that a confident team is almost always a well-performing team.
It’s much more pleasing to be part of a well-performing team where you spend time and energy solving complex problems compared to a stressful and chaotic team, where you fight already lost battles.
I’ve had the luxury of being part of well-performing teams, and I will try to collaborate on the key factors that made the teams well-performing.

## Shared responsibility

We have all heard about _SRP (Single-responsibility principle)_ which is a programming principle that states that every module/class/function should have the responsibility over one, and only one, of the functionalities of the application.
_SRP_ is appropriate to apply when it comes to programming, **but** a development team should definitely not follow it as a way of working principle.
They should do the opposite, the members should instead share the responsibility and knowledge. 
The knowledge required for a team to deliver should be shared so that they minimize the risk of ending up in situations like:

_- Oh look! Our application is not reachable due to NGINX issues! Where do we configure and manage our NGINX?_ <br>
_- Hmm, I have NO idea! The NGINX was deployed by X last year, but he left a month ago, and he was the only one that knew about the NGINX._

What a scary and stressful position to be in, right?
Luckily, a team can avoid ending up in this position by sharing responsibility and knowledge. 

Documentation is the best tool for a team to share responsibility and knowledge. 
A development team with a natural documentation culture where documentation is part of the team's daily work lowers the risk of ending up in the position above.
The key is that the documentation should be easily accessible and contain guides, instructions, and examples.
The internal documentation (read by the development team) is at least as crucial as the external documentation (read by the application user/customer).

A way of working principle that facilitates knowledge sharing is the principle to involve a greater portion of the team in each change. 
One of the members needs to initiate the change, but he/she should at least involve another team member during the development. Together, the members should discuss solution proposals and perform mob programming. A third and fourth person should then be involved in the review process. Preferably, the third and fourth person has their main expertise in another area. The team is now sharing the knowledge between four members instead of keeping it to only one person.

For a team that has adapted to a natural documentation culture and is involving more people in changes, the above DNS situation would probably look something like this:

_- Oh look! Our application is not reachable due to NGINX issues! Where do we configure and manage our NGINX?_ <br>
_- I remember being part of configuring the NGINX together with X last year. I think you can configure the records via this interface. If you get stuck, you can take a look at this wiki page which we created while deploying the NGINX. You should be able to find instructions regarding how to configure the NGINX._

Look how sharing responsibility can make the team exude confidence.

## Priotitize a stable ground
- Stable ground makes it possible to focus on other stuff 

## Well defined and common vision
