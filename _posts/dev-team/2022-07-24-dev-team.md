During my first three years as a software developer, I’ve been working in a few different teams and for me, working and delivering as a team is one of the most exciting parts of the work.
I’ve realized that a confident team is almost always a well-performing team.
It’s much more pleasing being part of a confident team where you spend time and energy on solving complex problems compared to a stressful and chaotic team, where you fight already lost battles.
I’ve had the luxury of being part of well-performing teams, and I will try to collaborate on the key factors that I think made the team confident.

## Shared responsibility

We have all heard about _SRP (Single-responsibility principle)_ which is a programming principle that states that every module/class/function should have responsibility over one, and only one, functionality of the application.
_SRP_ is most often relevant to follow when it comes to programming, **but** it should defiently not be followed when it comes to team development (?).
In a team, the responsibility and knowledge should be shared, since people will leave the team and people will join the team.
Most development team encounter work with a bunch of different technolgies,  (?) such as different frameworks, tools and programming languages.
The knowledge required for the team to deliver should be shared so that the does not end up in situations like:


_- Oh look! Our application is not reachable due to NGINX issues! Where do we configure and manage our NGINX?_ <br>
_- Hmm, I have NO idea! The NGINX was deployed by X last year, but he left a month ago, and he was the only one that knew about the NGINX._

What a scary and stressful sitation, right? The risk of reaching situations like the one above can be minimized by improving the teams ways of working.

The most important improvement is to to enhance a **natural documentation** culture.
Documentation should come natural, and be part of the daily work.
There shoule easy accesible installation and setup instructions, trouble shooting guides, deployment instructions and everything else the team might need in the future.
The internal documentation (consumed by the development team) is atleast as important as the external documentation (consumed by the application user/customer).

Another improvement to the teams way of working is to involve a bigger chunk of the team in each change and feature development.
Someone needs to take to lead on the change, but he/she should at least involve another team member during the developemnt to dicuss solution propals or for mob programming. A third and fourth person should then be involved in the review process. In this way, the knowledge is shared from the the person in lead of the change among three other team members.

For a team that has adapted to a natural documentation culture and is also involving more people a change, the above DNS situation would proably look something like:

_- Oh look! Our application is not reachable due to NGINX issues! Where do we configure and manage our NGINX?_ <br>
_- I remember being part of configuring the NGINX together with X last year, I think you can configure the records via this interface. If you get stuck, have a look a this wiki page that we created while deploying the NGINX, it should say something about how it can be configured._

Look how sharing responsibilty can make the team exude confidence.


## Priotitize a stable ground
- Stable ground makes it possible to focus on other stuff 

## Well defined and common vision
