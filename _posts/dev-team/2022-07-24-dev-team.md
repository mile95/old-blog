During my three years of working as a software developer I've been working in four different teams. 
To me, working and delivering as a team is one of the most exciting parts in the daily work.
By collecting the experience, and thanks to my interest in team development, I have gathered some key factors to what I think is important for a development team.


## Shared responsibility

- Members leave, members join
- A team should not be dependent on the knowledge and experience of one member.
- Tip: Inbox


## Priotitize a stable ground
- Stable ground makes it possible to focus development of the team.
- Automatic flows and tests
- Tip: Pipelines that can be trusted


## Well defined and common vision
- Why are we doing this?
- What are we trying to achive?
- Greater achivement and feel of accomplishment if the team succseeds with common goal.

## Summary

- Documentation
- Induvial confidnce
