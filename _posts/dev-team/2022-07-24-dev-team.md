During my first three years as a software developer, I’ve been working in a few different teams and for me, working and delivering as a team is one of the most exciting parts of the work.
I’ve realized that a confident team is almost always a well-performing team.
It’s much more pleasing being part of a confident team where you spend time and energy on solving complex problems compared to a stressful and chaotic team, where you fight already lost battles.
I’ve had the luxury of being part of well-performing teams, and I will try to collaborate on the key factors that I think made the team confident.

- Members leave, members join
- A team should not be dependent on the knowledge and experience of one member.
- Tip: Inbox


## Priotitize a stable ground
- Stable ground makes it possible to focus on other stuff 

## Well defined and common vision


## Summary
