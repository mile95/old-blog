description: "My development setup during 2023"

Recently I got this idea that I should start each year with a blog post explaining my current development setup and stuff around it. 
This would be great for tracking how my development setup changes and improves over time, but also work as a blueprint for me when I need to set up a new computer for development.
Beyond the development setup, I would like to go through some of the tools I use and what resources I use for daily learning.

## Operting Systen

Two years ago I switched from **Ubuntu** to **macOS** and to be fair, I do not see myself switching to anything else in the near future.
Everything just works on macOS, it is very seldom that the OS is preventing you from achiving what you want to achive.

I'm currently running **macOS Monterey 12.6** on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, M2, 2022).
