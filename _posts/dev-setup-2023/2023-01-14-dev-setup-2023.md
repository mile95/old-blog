description: "My development setup during 2023"

Recently I got this idea that I should start each year with a blog post explaining my current development setup and stuff around it. 
This would be great for tracking how my development setup changes and improves over time, but also work as a blueprint for me when I need to set up a new computer for development.
Beyond the development setup, I would like to go through some of the tools I use and what resources I use for daily learning.

## Operting Systen

Two years ago I switched from **Ubuntu** to **macOS** and to be fair, I do not see myself switching to anything else in the near future.
Everything just works on macOS, it is very seldom that the OS is preventing you from achiving what you want to achive.

I'm currently running **macOS Monterey 12.6** on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, M2, 2022).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) handling my zsh configuration.

### Configuration
One of the most important configurations for **iTerm** is that `⌘ + Q` opens up and and focuses the terminal on the right side of the window.
Some **zsh** configuration:
- Theme: gallifrey
- PS1 (prompt) variable: `PS1='%2~ $(git_prompt_info)%{%}%B»%b '`, this shows current directioty and git branch in a minimal fashion.

### Tools

There are only two tools that I use daily:

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to get an interactive command history search.
- [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) faster navigation

### Neovim - In terminal IDE

Most of the configuration for [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is copied from [this](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) setup.

- I use relative line numbers for fast navigation
- I have the following alias for **Neovim** `nv=neovim`

## IDE

My main IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Theme: **Material Theme Darker Higher Contrast**

The extensions I use are:

- **Vim** Key bindnings
- **Docker**
- **Draw.io Integration**

## Notes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for taking and maneging notes.

### Setup

I backup my notes using a git repository.
My obsidian vault is also a git repository and backups are created every 10 minutes.

The backups are created using the following simple backup script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd ~/Documents/dev/notes/
git add .
git commit -m "daily backup: `date +'%Y-%m-%d'`"
git push
```

This script is triggered every 10 minutes by **crontab** with the following configuration:

```
*/10 * * * * ./Documents/dev/notes/daily-backup.sh
```

I use the **Obsidian Nord** and **Dark** color schema.

The only plugins I use are **Relative Line Numbers** and **Vimrc Support**

### Templates

I have one template and that is for my daily notes.
The template is minamal and looks like:

```md
### Todo

- [ ] ...

### Notes

```

## Inspirations and Daily Learnings
