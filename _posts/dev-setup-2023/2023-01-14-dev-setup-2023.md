Recently I got this idea that I should start each year with a blog post explaining my current development setup and stuff around it. 
This would be great for tracking how my development setup changes and improves over time, but also work as a blueprint for me when I need to set up a new computer for development.
Beyond the development setup, I would like to go through some of the tools I use and what resources I use for daily learning.

## Terminal

## Tools

## Ide

## Notes

## Inspirations and Daily Learnings
