We just finished reading The 7 habits of highly effective people by Stephen R. Covey, and I will write about my main takeaways here as a blog post.

## Ask why

The first thing that comes to my mind when I think about this book is the *ask why* or *think why* part. Asking yourself *why* you do should x before you do x is the most fundamental thing, but it is not easy. To be able to answer the *why* you need to have some ideas about your personal mission statements. You should be able to answer the *why* based on your priorities in life which are set by your personal mission statements. Your personal mission statements should reflect what is important to YOU in YOUR life.

Before you decide to do anything or plan anything, you should reflect on how it corresponds to your personal mission statements. 

## Begin With The End in Mind

This one I really like! It is much easier to figure out how to do stuff if you begin with the end in mind. I feel like this fits perfectly in the daily work of a developer. You and your team should TOGETHER realize how you want something to work in the end. Based on this vision, you can easily identify key steps and milestones on the way to your team's vision. A shared vision of the goal, will increase your team's chances of reaching this goal. 

## Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood

I really need to become a better listener. This book made me realize the importance of being a good listener. It is impossible to always be a great listener, you don't have the energy to always listen fully to everyone. Again, based on your personal mission statements, you should decide to whom and when you should spend energy listening. One of the most important things is to be honest if you listen or not. If you don't have the energy at this very moment, be honest about it and suggest that the other person should talk to you later since you will be a better listener then. 

A good listener does not interupt with "solutions". A good listener tries to understand the problem from the other person's perspective and not his own. Most often, persons don't want input. Listen with the reason to understand, not with the reason the reply.
