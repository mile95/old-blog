In zsh, there exists `Hook Functions`, and one of these `Hook Functions` is the `preexec` function.
The `preexec` function is executed just after a command has been read and **before** it has been executed. 
In zsh, we can define a custom `prexec` function in the `.zshrc` configuration.

I will show how I utilized the `prexec` function to prompt for extra confirmation before running certain commands. This custom function will help me to think twice before running *critical* commands, for instance, commands targeting a production Kubernetes cluster.

In `.zshrc`, 

```bash

# Hooks

pre_validation() {
  # Get the current command
  local current_cmd=$(echo $1 | xargs)

  # Match the command against regexes
  if [[ "$current_cmd" =~ ^"rm -rf" ]] || \
     [[ "$current_cmd" =~ ^"git reset --hard HEAD" ]] || \
     [[ "$current_cmd" =~ ^"git add ." ]] || \
     [[ "$current_cmd" =~ .*"prod".* ]]; then
	echo "THIS COMMAND MATCHED THE DANGER FILTER! PLEASE CONFIRM THAT THE COMMAND SHOULD RUN."
	echo "[ANY] = confirm [Ctrl+c] = decline"
	read -sk key
  fi
}
```

The function is simple, 

1. Read the input command
1. Match the command against regexes
1. If the command matches any of the regexes
    1. Show a warning text
    1. Wait for user input by `read -sk key` which gives the user the possibility to send the `SIGINT` signal by `Ctrl + c`, hence terminating the process

To activate the custom `preexec` function, add these two lines the `.zshrc` and then run `source ~/.zshrc`

```
autoload -U add-zsh-hook                  # Load the zsh hook module
add-zsh-hook preexec pre_validation       # Adds the pre-hook
```

To deactivate the custom `preexec` function we need to add the following line

`add-zsh-hook -d preexec pre_validation`

Hopefully, this will help me to overcome the bad habit of running `git add .`.
