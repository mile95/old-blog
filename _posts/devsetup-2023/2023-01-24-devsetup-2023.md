This is the first installment of my annual development setup and tools blog series. Each year, I will be sharing my current development setup, including the tools and resources I use on a daily basis, as well as tracking how my setup evolves over time. Not only will this serve as a record of my own progress, but it will also serve as a helpful guide for anyone looking to set up a new computer for development. In this post, I'll be diving into the specifics of my development setup and the tools and resources I rely on for daily learning and productivity.

## Operating System

Two years ago, I made the switch from Ubuntu to macOS and have not looked back since. macOS has proven to be a reliable and efficient operating system for my needs. I am currently running macOS Monterey 12.6 on my MacBook Pro (13-inch, M2, 2022).

## Terminal

I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) as my terminal, with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) handling my zsh configuration. One of the most important configurations for iTerm is that `CMD + Q` opens and focuses the terminal on the right side of the current window.

### Configuration

In terms of zsh configuration, I am currently using the "gallifrey" theme and my PS1 (prompt) variable is set to `PS1='%2~ $(git_prompt_info)%{%}%BÂ»%b '`, which displays the current directory and git branch in a minimal, streamlined fashion.

### Tools

I rely on two tools on a daily basis:
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for interactive command history search
- [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump) for faster navigation.

These tools have greatly improved my workflow and efficiency in the terminal.

### Neovim - In-Terminal IDE

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as my in-terminal IDE and have configured it based on [this](https://github.com/LunarVim/nvim-basic-ide) setup.
- I use relative line numbers for fast navigation
- I have the following alias for Neovim `nv=neovim`

## IDE

My main IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Theme: **Material Theme Darker Higher Contrast**

The extensions I use are:
- **Vim** Key bindings
- **Docker**
- **Draw.io Integration**

## Notes

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for taking and managing notes.

### Setup

I backup my notes using a git repository. My Obsidian vault is also a git repository and backups are created every 10 minutes.

The backups are created using the following simple backup script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

cd ~/Documents/dev/notes/
git add .
git commit -m "daily backup: `date +'%Y-%m-%d'`"
git push
```

This script is triggered every 10 minutes by **crontab** with the following configuration:

```
*/10 * * * * ./Documents/dev/notes/daily-backup.sh
```

I use the **Obsidian Nord** and **Dark** color schema.

The only plugins I use are **Relative Line Numbers**,  **Vimrc Support** and **Kanban Board**

### Templates

I have one template and that is for my daily notes.
The template is minamal and looks like:

```md
### Todo

- [ ] ...

### Notes

```

## Inspirations and Daily Learnings

I start each workday with a daily reddit crawl and I tend to read posts under **/r/ExperiencedDevs/**, **r/devops** and **/r/python**.
Sometimes, I have a look at the front page of [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) aswell.

I reccomend; 

- [Anthonywritescode](https://www.twitch.tv/anthonywritescode) twitch and youtube for python and open source development.
- [cmgriffing](https://www.twitch.tv/cmgriffing) for web development and great soft tech discussions.
- [Lex Fridman](https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman)'s interviews!
