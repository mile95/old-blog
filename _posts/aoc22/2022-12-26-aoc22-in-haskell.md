This year (or last year...) I decided to try a new language for Advent Of Code.
I've been doing the previous years mostly in Python but this year I wanted to spice it up.
I have never finished all puzzled during the same year, I often loose my motiviation around day 15 or so when the two hours before work is not enough time to solve the puzzle of the day.

This year, I went for Haskell and this is how it went.

**All my solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/mile95/aoc22)**

Also, a great thanks to my friend Sarosh for helping me become better at Haskell!

## Day 0 (Template)

Before the first puzzle was released I needed to setup a temple and learn to basic of running haskell code.
The template was very minimal, it only contained the following code for reading the input file.

```haskell

main = do
        contents <- readFile "input.txt"
        let rows = lines contents
        print(rows)
```

I normally ran the solutions using `runhaskell` or `ghci` when I needed to debug. 

## Day 1 - 5 


## Day 5 - 10


## Day 10 - 15


## Day 15 - 20


## Day 20 - 25
