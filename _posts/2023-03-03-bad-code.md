This code is so bad!

How many times haven't we heard that exact statement now? Too many.
We, developers, have a bad habit of jumping to conclusions too fast, especially when we join a project with an existing code base.
Since it is not we that have written the code and the code is not looking like anything we recognize, the code has to be bad.

### Why does the code look this?

- Deadlines

- MVPs

- Different schools
