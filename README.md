A place for me to practice my technical writing, and at the same time, document my learnings.

This blog is running on Jekyll, and it is hosted on Github Pages.

To run locally:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise.git
$ cd jekyll-klise
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```


Thanks to [piharpi](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise) for the nice-looking theme!
